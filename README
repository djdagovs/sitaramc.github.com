Forking this repo

    Don't!

    This will get blown away (reset) every time.  Fork "git-notes" instead.

Why?

    Well I finally switched from WikiCreole to Markdown, but I still have a
    couple of customisations (notably the part that creates a TOC at the top),
    which prevent me from using the github's Jekyll as-is.

    So I do the conversion offline and push the HTML into its own repo.
