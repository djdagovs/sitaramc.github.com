<blockquote>
  <p>Newcomers to git often ask why there is such a thing as the index, and
    what use is it.  They'd rather just do <code>git add -A; git commit</code> each time
    to avoid thinking about the index at all, because it seems like one extra
    (and needless) complication.</p>

<p>So... what use is this, apart from confusing you with multiple names like
    index, staging area, and cache?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="what_is_the_index">what is the index</a></h3>

<p>The index (or any of its other names) is essentially a "holding area" for
changes that will be committed when you next do <code>git commit</code>.  That is, unlike
other VCSs, a "commit" operation does not simply take the current working tree
and check it as-is into the repository.  The index allows you to control what
parts of the working tree go into the repository on the next "commit"
operation.</p>

<p>That should be sufficient background to appreciate (in abstract terms) the
following discussion.</p>

<h3><a name="staging_helps_you_split_up_one_large_change_into_multiple_commits">staging helps you split up one large change into multiple commits</a></h3>

<p>Let's say you worked on a large-ish change, involving a lot of files and quite
a few different subtasks.  You didn't actually commit any of these -- you were
"in the zone", as they say, and you didn't want to think about splitting up
the commits the right way just then.  (And you're smart enough not to make the
whole thing on honking big commit!)</p>

<p>Now the change is all tested and working, you need to commit all this
properly, in several clean commits each focused on one aspect of the code
changes.</p>

<p>With the index, just stage each set of changes and commit until no more
changes are pending.  Really works well with <code>git gui</code> if you're into that
too, or you can use <code>git add -p</code> or, with newer gits, <code>git add -e</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="staging_helps_in_reviewing_changes">staging helps in reviewing changes</a></h3>

<p>Staging helps you "check off" individual changes as you review a complex
commit, and to concentrate on the stuff that has not yet passed your review.
Let me explain.</p>

<p>Before you commit, you'll probably review the whole change by using <code>git
diff</code>.  If you stage each change as you review it, you'll find that you can
concentrate better on the changes that are not yet staged.</p>

<p><code>git gui</code> is great here.  It's two left panes show unstaged and staged changes
respectively, and you can move files between those two panes
(stage/unstage) just by clicking on the icon to the left of the filename.</p>

<p>Even better, you can even stage <em>partial changes</em> to a file.  In the right
pane of <code>git gui</code>, right click on a change that you approve of and choose
"stage hunk".  <em>Just that change</em> (not the entire file) is now staged; in
fact, if there are other, unstaged, changes in that same file, you'll find
that the file now appears on <em>both</em> top and bottom left panes!</p>

<p><sup>[Do remember, however, that if the change is really complex maybe you should
split it into multiple commits!]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="staging_helps_when_a_merge_has_conflicts">staging helps when a merge has conflicts</a></h3>

<p>When a merge happens, changes that merge cleanly are updated both in the
staging area as well as in your work tree.  Only changes that did not merge
cleanly (i.e., caused a conflict) will show up when you do a <code>git diff</code>,
or in the top left pane of <code>git gui</code>.</p>

<p>Again, this lets you concentrate on the stuff that needs your attention -- the
merge conflicts.</p>

<h3><a name="staging_helps_you_keep_extra_local_files_hanging_around">staging helps you keep extra local files hanging around</a></h3>

<p>Usually, files that should not be committed go into <code>.gitignore</code> or the
local variant, <code>.git/info/exclude</code>.</p>

<p>However, sometimes you want a local change to a file that cannot be excluded
(which is not good practice but can happen sometimes).  For example, perhaps
you upgraded your build environment and it now requires an extra flag or
option for compatibility, but if you commit the change to the Makefile, the
other developers will have a problem.</p>

<p>Of course you have to discuss with your team and work out a more permanent
solution, but right now, you <em>need</em> that change in your working tree to do
<em>any</em> work at all!</p>

<p>Another situation could be that you want a new local file that is temporary,
and you don't want to bother with the ignore mechanism.  This may be some test
data, a log file or trace file, or a temporary shell script to automate some
test... whatever.</p>

<p>In git, all you have to do is never to stage that file or that change.  That's
it.</p>

<h3><a name="staging_helps_you_sneak_in_small_changes_">staging helps you sneak in small changes ;-)</a></h3>

<p>Let's say you're in the middle of a somewhat large-ish change and you are told
about a very important bug that needs to be fixed asap.</p>

<p>The usual recommendation is to do this on a separate branch, but let's say
this fix is really just a line or two, and can be tested just as easily
without affecting your current work.</p>

<p>With git, you can quickly make and commit <em>only that change</em>, without
committing all the other stuff you're still working on.</p>

<p>Again, if you use <code>git gui</code>, whatever's on the bottom left pane gets
committed, so just make sure only that change gets there and commit, then
push!</p>

<h4><a name="a_word_of_warning_">a word of warning...</a></h4>

<p>While the first 3 use cases are perfectly legitimate and useful uses of the
index, this last example could be dangerous if you get carried away.  You
might end up committing something that is not tested <em>exactly</em>, because you
tested with the contents of the work tree, which is not the same as the index
that is being committed.</p>

<p>Of course, using a powerful DVCS does not absolve you from the responsibility
of thinking :-)  So if you want to be 100% sure, there is a simple way to test
only the staged code:</p>

<pre><code># stash away the changes to git-tracked files that you have not staged yet
git stash save --keep-index
# now do your tests on the exact stuff being committed
make; make test     # etc...
# when satisfied, commmit
git commit

# now bring the stashed changes back to continue normal work
git stash pop
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to understand how/why this works, <a href="mailto:sitaramc@gmail.com">ask
me</a>, otherwise just use it and be happy :-)</p>
